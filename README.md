 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

Prototype 1: The Walls are Lava!
Collect coins, don't touch the walls, and make it to the flag!
Get 5 out of 5 coins before getting to the flag to win.
Red walls are deadly, if you touch them then it's game over and try again.

Precision games can be challenging, and challenges make games fun. With a title that parodies the make-believe game "the floor is lava", run through a maze where you can't touch the walls as a slightly unwieldy sphere. This game has some inspiration from Flappy Bird.
